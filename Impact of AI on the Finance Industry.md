## Impact of AI on the Finance Industry

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping industries, and the structure of the global finance industry is also changing, with financial sector spending on AI projected to reach $97 billion by 2027 (Kearns, 2023). The role of AI in finance is growing, with applications across all areas of the industry, including in customer service chatbots and algorithmic trading (Ranković et al., 2023). As the application and future development of AI is underway, considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies is imperative to understanding the impact of AI on the industry as well as wider society.

The benefits of AI in finance become apparent in the context of making decisions quickly. Through processing and analysis of large datasets, automation of decision-making for tasks such as credit assessment and investment may lead to increased efficacy and efficiency (Maple et al., 2024). Pattern recognition also lends use to applications in fraud detection and forecasting, whilst the development of generative AI will likely see more personalised recommendations and communication, without need for much human input. These result in possibly more accurate, fast and safe banking. Another benefit to consider is the integration of AI with other disruptive technologies, such as blockchain, which may change the landscape of finance by providing more efficient, transparent and secure transactions, and potentially streamlining other processes (Evans, 2024).

The benefits of AI are not without drawbacks, and in addition to human resistance and lack of proficiency in AI use, there are currently obstacles to the widespread implementation of AI in finance. With increased AI implementation, reduction in jobs and mass displacement is a significant problem, whilst concerns about lack of human oversight, ethics, transparency and privacy still pose questions over the value and risk of AI (Maple et al., 2024). Another major factor is the regulation of AI, wherein current laws and policies are insufficient to keep up with the speed of AI growth and its layered complexities. Further, it may be relevant to consider the perspective of banks and central organisations in regards to the decentralisation of finance that may arise from certain uses of AI (Vuković, Dekpo-Adza and Matović, 2025).

It can be seen that AI is and will continue to impact the finance sector, creating multi-dimensional benefits for clients, workers and organisations. At the same time, insufficient regulation and strategies to manage AI may have detrimental impacts on the industry and its customers, and potentially cause more widespread issues in the global economy.
